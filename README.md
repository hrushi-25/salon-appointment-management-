# salon-appointment-management-
This project addresses the common issue of long wait times at salons by allowing users to book appointments in advance, eliminating the need to wait for extended periods upon arrival. By enabling users to schedule their appointments, the solution not only saves time for the customers but also improves operational efficiency for salon administrators. This streamlined approach benefits both parties, as users can plan their visits more conveniently, and salon staff can manage their schedules more effectively.
